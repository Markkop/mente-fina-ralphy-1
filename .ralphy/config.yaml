# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
# These are injected into every prompt
rules:
  - "Always use TypeScript strict mode"
  - "Use Next.js App Router patterns (not Pages Router)"
  - "Follow local-first architecture: all data stored in IndexedDB via Dexie.js, never use external backend APIs for data storage"
  - "Use Zustand for global state management, synced with Dexie"
  - "Use ShadCN/UI components for consistent UI styling"
  - "OpenAI API key must be stored in LocalStorage (never sent to backend)"
  - "Use Vercel AI SDK (client-side) for chat integration"
  - "Respect the hierarchical data structure: Goals (can nest), Requirements (informational), Milestones (checkpoints), Tasks (actionable with frequency)"
  - "All user data is self-verified - no external tracking integrations"
  - "Privacy first: all operations happen client-side"
  - "Use lucide-react for icons"
  - "Follow the implementation checklist in PRD.md for feature development order"

# Boundaries - files/folders the AI should not modify
boundaries:
  never_touch:
    # Examples:
    # - "src/legacy/**"
    # - "migrations/**"
    # - "*.lock"
